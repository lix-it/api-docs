# Disambiguation API

The Disambiguation API provides endpoints for converting and cross-referencing different types of IDs across LinkedIn's ecosystem. This includes converting between LinkedIn profile URLs, Sales Navigator URLs, and Lix's internal IDs for both people and organizations.

<Note>
These endpoints help you maintain consistency across different LinkedIn interfaces and ensure you're working with the correct entity regardless of the source.
</Note>

## Available Endpoints

The API provides two main endpoints:
- Person IDs: Convert between LinkedIn profile, Sales Navigator, and Lix IDs for individuals
- Organisation IDs: Convert between company profile URLs and IDs across different LinkedIn interfaces
