# Introduction

Welcome to Lix's API! You can use this API to access all our API endpoints, such as the Person API to look up email addresses, or the Company API to look up company information related to a domain name.

The API is organized around REST. All requests should be made over SSL. All request and response bodies, including errors, are encoded in JSON.

We also have some specific language code examples to make integration easier. You can switch the programming language of the examples with the tabs in the top right.

Currently we have code examples for the following languages:

- Node
- Python
- Go
- Javascript
- Java

Should you have further questions, feel free to contact our tech team via email at [help@lix-it.com](mailto:help@lix-it.com) or by using the web chat in the bottom right of your screen.

# Authentication

> To authorize, use this code:

```ruby
require 'lix'

api = Lix::APIClient.authorize!('lixApiKey')
```

```python
import lix

api = lix.authorize('lixApiKey')
```

```shell
# With shell, you can just pass the correct header with each request
curl "api_endpoint_here" \
  -H "Authorization: lixApiKey"
```

```javascript
const lix = require('lix');

let api = lix.authorize('lixApiKey');
```

> Make sure to replace `lixApiKey` with your API key.

Lix uses API keys to allow access to the API. If you do not have an API Token yet, please [contact our sales team](mailto:help@lix-it.com) to receive one.

Lix expects for the API key to be included in all API requests to the server in a header that looks like the following:

`Authorization: lixApiKey`

or with a query variable:

`https://api.lix-it.com/v1/person?profile_link=https://linkedin.com/in/alfie-lambert&api_key=lixApiKey`

Please bear in mind to also specify the Content-Type as application/json format.


<aside class="notice">
You must replace <code>lixApiKey</code> with your personal API key.
