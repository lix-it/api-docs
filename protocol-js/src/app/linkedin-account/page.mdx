# LinkedIn Account API

## Connections

This endpoint retrieves the connections for the viewerId.

<aside class="notice">
In order to retrieve connections for your account you need to have your LinkedIn account connected to your Lix account using the Lix extension. 

[Instructions on how to do that here](https://help.lix-it.com/en/articles/6784916-how-to-install-the-lix-extension).
