# Introduction

Welcome to Lix's API! You can use this API to access all our API endpoints, such as the Contact API to look up email addresses by LinkedIn profile ID, or the People API to look up professional information for a person.

## About the API {{ anchor: false }}

The API is organized around REST. All requests should be made over SSL. All request and response bodies, including errors, are encoded in JSON.

We also have some specific language code examples to make integration easier. You can switch the programming language of the examples with the tabs in the top right.

Currently we have code examples for the following languages:

- Node
- Python 3
- Go
- Javascript
- Java

Should you have further questions, feel free to contact our tech team via email at help@lix-it.com or by using the web chat in the bottom right of your screen.
