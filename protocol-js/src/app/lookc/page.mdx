# LookC API

<Row>

<Col>

## Asynchronous Requests

Our LookC endpoints may take some time to fetch data, so we have added concept of an 'asynchronous request' to this API. This is a request that will complete in the background and you will receive a call to a webhook when this query is complete, or you can check on the progress of this request using the request_id query parameter.

If an endpoint is asynchronous it will be designated as async enabled in the documentation.

### Checking the Status of an Asynchronous Request

You can check the status of an asynchronous request by passing the `request_id` into the `request_id` query parameter.

### HTTP Request

`GET https://api.lookc.io/v1/search/person/by-email`

Parameter | Description
--------- | -----------
request_id     | The request ID of the asynchronous request you are checking.




### Webhooks

If you have set up a webhook in your dashboard the webhook will be notified when the request is complete. The `type` field will be the name of the endpoint and the `data` field will be the response.
