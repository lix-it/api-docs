# API Productivity

We organise our APIs into different collections, each of which we call an 'API', with each API having a number of endpoints.

## API Specs & Postman 

At Lix, we love [Postman](https://postman.com), we think it's a great way to share APIs and make them easily accessible for your team. If a Postman collection is available for an API, you will find a 'Run in Postman' link at the top of the API collection. You will need to add your own environment with the `api_key` variable to use the collection.

If you would like our OpenAPI v3.1 specification we can also send that across, let us know through our live chat.
