# Authentication

> Make sure to replace `lixApiKey` with your API key.

Lix uses API keys to allow access to the API. If you do not have an API Token yet, please [visit your API dashboard](https://lix-it.com/home/api) to generate one. You will need to verify your identity first, it's a simple process that takes less than a minute. You can see more information about our verification process [here](https://help.lix-it.com/en/articles/8074514-how-to-verify-your-identity).

Lix expects for the API key to be included in all API requests to the server in a header that looks like the following:

`Authorization: lixApiKey`

or with a query variable:

`https://api.lix-it.com/v1/person?profile_link=https://linkedin.com/in/alfie-lambert&api_key=lixApiKey`

Please bear in mind to also specify the Content-Type as application/json format.


<aside class="notice">
You must replace <code>lixApiKey</code> with your personal API key.

> To authorize, use this code:

```python
import requests

url = "https://api.lix-it.com/v1/person?profile_link=https://linkedin.com/in/alfie-lambert"

payload={}
headers = {
  'Authorization': lix_api_key
}

response = requests.request("GET", url, headers=headers, data=payload)

print(response.json())
```

```javascript
const axios = require('axios');

const url = "https://api.lix-it.com/v1/person?profile_link=https://linkedin.com/in/alfie-lambert";

const headers = {
  'Authorization': lixApiKey,
}

const response = axios.get(url, headers);

console.log(response.data);
```

```
package main

import (
  "fmt"
  "io/ioutil"
  "net/http"
)

func main() {
  req, _ := http.NewRequest("GET", "https://api.lix-it.com/v1/person?profile_link=https://linkedin.com/in/alfie-lambert", nil)

  req.SetHeaders

}
```

```shell
# With shell, you can just pass the correct header with each request
curl "api_endpoint_here" \
  -H "Authorization: lixApiKey"
```
